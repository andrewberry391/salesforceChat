# Salesforce Android Chat Setup with based off [SnapinsSDKExample](https://github.com/forcedotcom/ServiceSDK-Android/tree/master/Examples/SnapinsSDKExample) project
A android studio project connected to my personal salesforce dev environment for testing mobile chat implementation.

The Base app was made from following the instructions on the following modules in order:
1. [Install Common Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/mobilesdk_setup_dev_tools/mobilesdk_setup_common)
2. [Set Up Your Android Development](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/mobilesdk_setup_dev_tools/mobilesdk_setup_android)

The base app is built off of [SnapinsSDKExample](https://github.com/forcedotcom/ServiceSDK-Android/tree/master/Examples/SnapinsSDKExample) and I set up my console and looked for isntructions for how to modify it to work for me from the following articles:
* [Org Setup for Chat in Lightning Experience with a Guided Flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.service_sdk_android.meta/service_sdk_android/live_agent_cloud_setup.htm#ess_live_agent_cloud_setup)
